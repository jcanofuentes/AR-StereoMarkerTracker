# Augmented Reality in Maxillofacial Surgery

## Introduction
This repository contains the source code for the pioneering application developed in 2009 that utilized augmented reality in maxillofacial surgery. The software captures images from two cameras, identifies markers, and computes 3D positions. It navigates through calibration and tracking states, leveraging computer vision and 3D rendering capabilities.

## ⚠️ Important Note
As of now, it is practically impossible to get this code running due to outdated dependencies and libraries. However, it is preserved here in the hopes that it might be of use to someone, either for educational purposes or as a foundation for further development.

## Technology Stack
The application was built using the Cing library, a C++ library inspired by Processing for creative coding. Cing aimed to bring the power of C++ to designers and artists using Processing's syntax. Furthermore, Cing was built upon several other libraries including:
- OpenCV: For computer vision tasks.
- Ogre: Used for 3D rendering.
- FMOD: For audio handling.
- Bullet: For physics simulations.
 

## Features
- Image capturing from dual cameras.
- Marker identification and tracking.
- 3D position computation.
- Calibration and tracking capabilities.
- Utilization of the Cing library for computer vision and 3D rendering.

## Dependencies
- [Cing library] (https://github.com/CingProject/Cing)

## Installation & Setup
Given the age and dependencies of this project, setting it up might be challenging. Refer to the original documentation of the Cing library for potential guidance.
